title: "The case for shorting options"

Spoiler: This is a case for investing in the riskiest asset of all: Being short options contracts. There are many articles about this online, but I wanted to do this systematically, myself.


### The case for investing

The core idea is that governments and corporations, in aggregate, produce more than they consume. 

Is there reason to believe this to be true? I think yes: This is a rough corollary of the axiom that humanity is not coming to an end, and that the earth has not run dry. For if people (in aggregate) consumed more than they produced, then humanity's inventory of goods would quickly deplete and that would be that. And since there is no reason to believe that humans consume exactly as much as they produce, we arrive at the claim.

The claim has empirical backing. The usual claim is that the SP500 index appreciates at about a rate of 7% per year in the US, after inflation.

### The case for investing in riskier assets

The core idea here is that humans are risk averse, so that riskier assets enjoy higher rates of appreciation. 

There is some ambiguity as to what "risk" means here. 

> I will use an example of two companies A and B. Company A has a 50% chance of doubling its profits and a 50% chance of vanishing. Company B has a 25% chance of quadrupling and a 75% chance of vanishing. Then company B is riskier.

So is there reason to believe humans to be risk averse? I also think yes. This is a rough corollary of diminishing marginal utility. The extra 2x that company B potentially offers is less valuable not only because it is less likely, but also because its marginal utility is diminished. So company A is preferable.

This claim has solid empirical backing at certain market scales. For instance, there is little doubt that the typical corporate stock has greater risk than the typical bond. Accordingly, a typical basket of stocks will appreciate faster than a basket of bonds.

### The case against investing in riskier assets

The core idea here is that risk aversion breaks down at the extremes.

Is there reason to believe this to be true? Actually, I can't really think of a fundamental principle.

But the claim has solid empirical backing. For instance, within the equities market itself, backing for active investing is much weaker. By the risk-aversion principle, a basket of small caps should appreciate faster than a basket of blue chips. 

However, historically, such an advantage has not been clear, if not [outright absent](https://www.longtermtrends.net/large-cap-vs-small-cap/). Competiting psychological forces are evidently at play. These are roughly the same forces which contribute to bubble formation, and which allow lotteries to function.

### The case for shorting options contracts

The case for shorting options contracts is the union of the case for riskier assets, and the case against riskier assets.

Typical options buyers are "rational" and help the discovery of options prices which align with typical risk-aversion principles. Such options buyers see options as risk reduction products (eg. as part of a protective put strategy, or more generally to expose themselves to risky investments while limiting downside). Options sellers adopt a fair amount of risk to provide these contracts, so in principle should be compensated above fair expected value, and in fact above the opportunity cost of a typical passive equity portfolio.

Why doesn't the case against investing in risky assets apply here? The argument there would suggest that a risk-philic sub-population would relish shorting options contracts, driving prices below fair value, and making the short strategy suboptimal.

The claim is that this doesn't happen. In fact, instead of working _against_ typical risk-aversion principles, bubble-forming hype works in _conjunction_ with risk-aversion principles in the options markets, further pushing up the price of options premiums beyond fair expected value. Precisely, the claim is that the risk-philic sub-population buys options contracts, instead of selling them.

Is there reason to believe this to be true? Yes, with the following explanation: It takes large amounts of capital for both rational parties discussed so far to enact their strategies. For instance, a protective put strategy requires owning the stock, which requires capital, while shorting a put contract requires collateral capital as well. The irrational risk-philic sub-population doesn't have access to such large amounts of capital. The one trading strategy available to them is to be long options contracts - driving up their prices beyond fair value.

To summarize, I have hinted at five strategies:

1. passive investing, 
2. active trading,
3. active trading with protective options, 
4. active trading, short options,
5. short-stack trading, long options.

Passive investors form the benchmark. Strategy (2) is conceivably effective (eg. Warren Buffett) but I have no idea how one might succeed there. Strategy (3) is also fair, but those using strategy (5) make things extra difficult on two fronts: By crowding both promising growth stocks, and the options contracts that might be used to protect them. The appeal of strategy (4) is that it has a natural gatekeeper in the way of high capital requirements, and thus works with the current rather than against it.
