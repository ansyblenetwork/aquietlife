title: "Tactics VII: Position sizing"

This post actually ties together three related questions:

1. We revisit the question of how often your trades should [lose]({% post_url 2021-08-07-wheeling-rolling %}).
2. We revisit the question of choosing strikes, or equivalently, [rates of return]({% post_url 2021-07-05-choosing-strikes %}).
3. We consider the new question of position sizing.


### Revisiting loss frequency

I stated in the previous discussion about wheeling and rolling that you should aim to lose at least sometimes, to indicate a criticial level of capital efficiency.

It is pretty obvious that never losing is not optimal; It's pretty easy to never lose trades but this is inconsistent with the actual objective, which is profit. (For instance, one easy way to never lose is to never trade.)

It is less obvious that the optimal percentage of losses is not some higher positive number, and in fact, it very well might be.

My suspicion however is that it is not. First, I would hesitate to discount the efficiency of the market as soon as positive amounts of money can be made by both sides. In other words, I suspect that options contracts very quickly turn into pure speculative instruments as soon as there is liquidity. Second, there is no reason to assume that the a liquid speculative market favors either side of the trade. Third, you want almost none of your capital to be used on fair bets, ie. bets which have an expected return of zero. This is especially true as an options seller, since any bet locks up a lot of collateral.

I think the weakest link in that chain of reasoning is the first point: Why would market efficiencies drop off steeply as soon as the long side might reasonably profit from the trade? I think this is reflected in the roughly Gaussian distribution of volumes. There isn't much reason to suspect that the volume of "inefficient trades" grows in proportion to overall volume. I expect something more like a nearly uniform distribution, but even if not, the ratio of efficient trades to inefficient trades almost certainly favors the tails. Inching even a little into the bulk of the trading volume quickly makes you into a trader of essentially fair bets.


### Revisiting rates of return

Given the above discussion about losses, we have a more concrete recommendation for how to choose a rate of return, beyond "try to earn less." Aim for low volumes, as a proxy for aiming to almost never lose. This in turn is a proxy for making sure you are trading instruments which are dominated by inefficient pricing.

Note that often, strikes may have low volumes simply because of herding. For instance, a 50 dollar strike may capture all the volume, leaving the 51 dollar strike with almost no volume, but this is a meaningless piece of information from the perspective of not losing. As a result, a more accurate criteria may be some measure of cumulative volume.


### Position sizing and opportunism

It wasn't obvious to me at first whether confidence as a result of a good opportunity should manifest in terms of chasing a more aggressive rate of return, or more aggressive sizing. The above discussion regarding how to choose rate of return suggests that this degree of freedom is not really free. So confidence should be reflected in sizing, which is actually just a quantitative way of asking, should you open a trade?

I think here is is the beginning of discretion and opportunism, and where I should stop trying to ofter systematic advice.

However, a comment. I recently learned about the Kelly criterion for position sizing. The apparently optimal sizing for a double-or-nothing bet, as a proportion of your assets, is p - q, where p is the probability of winning and q is the probability of losing.

For uneven bets, p and q should be scaled accordingly. For instance, I would estimate that a typical loss on a bad options trade is about 20%. Then p should be scaled by 5. If a typical win is about 2%, then q should be scaled by 50. If 5% of trades go bad, the criterion actually suggests you should leverage. If 10% of trades go bad, then the trade is losing and should be avoided.

These computations are indicative of the finess of this business. Note however, that in options trading, you can control your gains fairly precisely. As discussed above, relatively systematic considerations (like tracking how often your trades lose, or chasing low volumes) should roughly determine the size of a typical win. If you place stop losses, you also control the size of a loss. 

The Kelly criterison says that in this setting, the correct sizing is determined by one number: The probability that a particular trade will win.
