title: "In defense of Robinhood"

There is a lot of criticism of Robinhood on all sides, including by Charlie Munger and Warren Buffet. In a recent interview:

> Asked about Robinhood, Munger called the stock trading app “a gambling parlor masquerading as a respectable business.”
>
> “Robinhood is not encouraging people to buy a very, very, very low-cost index fund and hold it for 50 years,” Buffett said. “I will guarantee you that you will not walk in there, get that advice. Instead, you’ll get advice on how you can trade options.”
> 
> Munger also suggested apps like Robinhood aren’t comission-free because the real costs—namely the process of payment for order flow—are hidden.
> 
> “It’s basically a sleazy, disreputable operation,” Munger said. “And the interesting thing about it is that some good people you would be glad to have marry into your family have backed it.”

I would like to consider myself part of that last category. I am on the whole, a supporter of Robinhood. Here are my thoughts.


### Concessions and ground rules

Lotteries are sleazy; I believe Buffett used the terminology, "a tax on hope." I will agree to that, and that a segment of Robinhood has lottery-like elements to it.

I will also agree that Robinhood, in isolation, has not been transparent about its main revenue source, payment for order flow.

There is however, one class of arguments that I cannot agree with: That, because Robinhood can be combined with ignorance and misinformation to do harm, it should never have been created, or should be shut down.

This perspective requires a paternalistic and pessimistic opinion of humanity that, if true, would render this and many other discussions irrelevant. A sort of reverse Pascal's wager requires us to dismiss this point, and to instead adopt the belief that ignorance can be remedied and misinformation demonetized.

### Comissions

Trades on Robinhood are not free. Robinhood accepts payment for order flow. But a recent stat revealed that Robinhood has about 18 million accounts with 80 billion dollars in assets, or about 4500 dollars per account. Immediately preceding Robinhood, typical brokerages charged 5 to 10 dollars of comission per trade. Assuming trades on the order of hundreds of dollars, it was not really misleading to say that trades were essentially free on Robinhood, compared to the then industry standard.

Which in fact, is not what Robinhood claimed or claims. Robinhood claims its trades are comission-free, not free. First, it should be observed that a lot of brokerages use the same language while also accepting payment for order flow. Second, other brokerages actually use the same language while charging other fees (the most notorious being the 65 cent per-contract options fee).

The worst one could say about Robinhood is that it is dishonest in a dishonest industry, which for at least a decade lied by implication, charging comissions for a service which cost brokerages essentially nothing.

(One could argue here that comission-free trading encourages traders to trade too often. See the ground rules above.)

It remains to discuss payment for order flow. What is it, and what are the consequences for the retail trader?
