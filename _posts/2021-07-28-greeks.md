title: "The case against options Greeks"
---

The Black-Scholes model for options pricing is a very nice piece of mathematics. 

However, I am unaware of any theoretical or notational significance for the associated options Greeks. To justify their existence, they need to be have empirical value. Unfortunately, I am not aware of any reason to think that they succeed in this. I am reminded of this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW6LYuli7VU) with Richard Feynman:

Here is a transcript of the relevant anecdote:

> My cousin, at that time, who was three years older, was in high school and was having considerable difficulty with his algebra and had a tutor come, and I was allowed to sit in a corner while the tutor would try to teach my cousin algebra, problems like 2x plus something. I said to my cousin then, "What’re you trying to do?" You know, I hear him talking about x. He says, "What do you know 2x + 7 is equal to 15," he says "and you’re trying to find out what x is." I says, "you mean 4." He says, "Yeah, but you did it with arithmetic, you have to do it by algebra."

> And that's why my cousin was never able to do algebra, because he didn’t understand how he was supposed to do it. There was no way. I learnt algebra fortunately by not going to school and knowing the whole idea was to find out what x was and it didn’t make any difference how you did it – there’s no such thing as you know, you do it by arithmetic, you do it by algebra – that was a false thing that they had invented in school so that the children who have to study algebra can all pass it.
