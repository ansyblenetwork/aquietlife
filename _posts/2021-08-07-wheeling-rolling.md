title: "Options Tactics VI: Wheeling, rolling, and losing"
---

When a trade is challenged by assignment (or in the case of a spread, liquidation), should you take assignment, roll the trade, or exit the trade?

Unlike a lot of other tactical questions regarding options trading, there seems to be some disagreement on the internet, with reasonable adoption of all three approaches.

My take: Roll rather than wheel, view both as losses, but aim to lose occasionally.



### Wheeling vs. rolling

If you believe your options trading thesis, rolling is clearly better than wheeling. This is easy to see: Your trading thesis has you trading options, not stocks, so you should not keep stocks in your portfolio.

Rolling also has the (minor) advantage of capturing weekend decay. Wheeling on a typical broker prevents selling covered calls until Monday.

There are a few reasons you might want to wheel, however.

1. You are tired of trading, you have been trading on underlyings of stocks you like, and want to transition to an investment portfolio.
2. There is a strong asymmetry in the options chain. In some stocks, call options are unusually valuable compared to puts. This might happen, for instance, with a decent underlying with strong fundamentals and bad news. (I'm thinking of some Chinese stocks in the recent market.)


### Losing 

Sometimes people talk about "wanting assignment" in the course of a wheel strategy. However, there is no such thing as a good options loss. Part of the game is correctly predicting a stock's Friday market price. Being wrong has (high) opportunity costs. If you were better at the game, you would not get assigned, but instead have your position expire at the money and buy the underlying after hours on Friday with your released collateral.

(People rarely talk about wanting to roll their positions - another nominal advantage of rolling.)

This doesn't mean that wheeling and rolling are necessarily bad responses to losing trades. Both wheeling and rolling have the advantage of capturing mean-reversion tendencies. Typically, a trade which ends in management is a surprise mixed in with some capitulation, and some mean-reversion is in store. (Even if this is not reflected in the underlying stock price, it is typically reflected in the options chain via inflated premiums.) 

However, it is easy to lean too much into both management strategies. Trading to break even on a losing trade typically induces a position that is larger or riskier than the trader would have taken in the absence of the preceding loss.

### Aim to lose

Use losses as indicators.

1. Expect or even aim to have a few losing trades a month. Having no losses is indicative of strikes that are too far out of the money, with unearned premium as an opportunity cost.
2. View losses as events that bring your attention to good trades. Use either wheeling or rolling as trading strategies, not management strategies. Trade your strategy and trade to win, not to break even.

The nice thing about losses on options trades is that the positives are all correlated. If your losses are rare, they should also be small; and if your losses are small, it should be easy to strip emotions from your management strategy.
