title: "Buy capital, never premium"
---

According to the principle of capital efficiency with respect to the [case for shorting options contracts]({% post_url 2021-06-28-case-for-trading %}), you should never buy extrinsic value, or premium.

This rule is absolute. Some contrarian implications include:

1. You should not spend more than the least possible amount on defensive legs of spreads or other multi-leg strategies.
2. You should not "take profits at 50% or 21 DTE," a popular recommendation of Tasty Trade.


### Never buy extrinsic value

More generally, there is no reason to think that the case for shorting options can be ignored depending on your trading circumstances. In fact, adherence to the rule is the whole point of being an options seller. The skill and service of an option seller is to be willing to go through some inconvenience to develop risk management for him/herself from scratch and for free, rather than paying someone else to offer a guarantee.

Another way to think about this is to ask when you would buy an options contract in isolation. For a true believer in the case for shorting options contracts, the answer should be: essentially never.


### Buy capital at a reasonable interest rate

The defensive leg of a spread offers two unrelated services: 

1. speculation,
2. release of capital.

You should never sell a spread while expecting to take a total loss. (If you did, you should be buying the spread instead.) In particular, when you sell a spread, you should fully expect to take a total loss on the defensive leg of the spread. In other words, you should value (1) at essentially zero.

With this in mind, you should view the defensive leg of a spread as overvalued unless it releases capital to you at a reasonable interest rate. 

What is a reasonable interest rate? I personally indulge a bit. In principle, your broker's margin rate is the correct comparison, but I typically allow myself to pay a 10% annual rate. This would be like buying a 7 DTE 10 dollar strike for 2 dollars.

The same interest rate analysis answers the question of when to close a contract. (There are of course, exceptions. For instance, there are reasons to close a trade early if fundamental issues have arisen for the underlying stock.)
