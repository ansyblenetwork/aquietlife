title: "Legging into spreads"
---

As a general life principle, you should only buy something in bulk if there is a discount. 

Otherwise, you should buy a product as needed. Circumstances change over time, and you may change your mind about the product. Prices may also change, and you may be able to find a better deal later on, especially if you have some knowledge about the pricing history of the product.

This is the high-level rationale for legging into spreads.

Note that if you are following the recommendation to [spend very little buying defensive spreads]({% post_url 2021-07-06-buying-premium %}), this is less of a concern. However, it is still a useful concept to reduce slippage. Depending on your brokerage, execution of single contracts is more reliable than execution of spreads. (This appears true of Robinhood, for instance.)

There are also a few strategies associated with the general concept of legging.


### Seeding

A strategy that I invented but have never really been able to succeed with is what I call "seeding." This refers to buying cheap, 1 or 5 dollar contracts preemptively, in an assortment of underlying stocks which you suspect might jump or sink in the future.

Many of these will expire worthless, but sometimes a stock will move in a direction that favors the "seed." At this point you have two choices: if the seed has grown in value substantially, you may choose to just sell the option at a handsome percentage gain.

However, if the underlying moves but the seed hasn't meaningfully grown, all is not lost: You can short an option nearer to market price to complete the spread. The seed allows you to do this in a very capital efficient way.

I suspect that such a strategy could be effective in low volatility environments, when opportunities are rare. This has not been the case for the last year or more.


### Calendar spreads

Similar in spirit to seeding, you can buy the defensive leg of a spread but choose a long expiration. Then, you can short weekly contracts with reduced collateral, week after week until the expiration of the defensive leg arrives.

I have tried this strategy but find that it generally does not work well. This is akin to buying a season pass for shorting weeklys with reduced collateral. The pass doesn't work very well, however. 

One way to think about this is that in the absence of such a season pass, you would probably vary the strike price of your defensive leg. The season pass disallows this.

This might, however, be a viable strategy in a low volatility environment, or on a low volatility stock.
