title: "Opportunism, capital efficiency, and diversification: The principles of trading"
---

Every trading decision should be backed by a thesis. In turn, my theses typically uphold one or more of the following principles:

1. Opportunism,
2. Capital efficiency,
3. Diversification.

OCD for short. Opportunistic theses should happen the least often, while decisions driven by diversification should happen almost all the time.


### Opportunism and market inefficiencies

Opportunism refers to market inefficiencies, including instances of irrationality, misinformation, or arbitrage. These opportunities occur with low uncertainty/variance, and thus are very potent. They should be rare.

However, I will point out that the options market conceivably enlarges what one would consider opportunistic. It is very hard to predict whether a stock will go up or down, at least on time scales short enough for trading to be meaningful. The conventional wisdom is that it is much easier to predict whether an options contract will expire out of the money. This is particularly true near expiration - precisely the time scale at which trading is meaningful, and at which impulsive traders enjoy speculating.

Recent market conditions appear to be full of inefficiencies. The most transparent I found recently involved the merger/dividend debacle regarding TRCH. I honestly felt a little guilty entering the trade; the stock was evidently rife with novice and misinformed investors.

### Capital efficiency and risk management

The [general case for shorting options]({% post_url 2021-06-28-case-for-trading %}) suggests that one should be invested at all times, using as much capital as possible.

There is more to this than the fact that shorting options contracts has positive expected value. Options chains allow you to freely exchange capital for not just returns, but also reduced risk (for instance, by lowering your strikes).

More generally, this principle stands on the principle that if you are trading a particular strategy that has better than expected returns relative to risk, then you should feel comfortable using all of your capital to trade that strategy. 

### Diversification and exploration

Keep in mind that there are many ways to diversify. Here is a sample list:

1. Trade in different stocks.
2. Trade in both small caps and large caps.
3. Open both bullish and bearish trades.
4. Leg into your spreads rather than opening them at once.

Unlike with opportunism and capital efficiency, options trading arguably hurts your ability to diversify due to the minimum size of options contracts. On the other hand, a judicious use of spreads makes options trading very flexible in this regard too.

A remark: There are some clips of Warren Buffett criticizing diversification as protection against ignorance. I don't disagree, but my issue with this is as follows:

1. It's a bit much to presume you can evaluate businesses as well as Buffett.
2. Even if it turns out you do have this natural ability, you couldn't be sure without a few decades in the market. Life is too short for such experimentation.
3. Someone who understands business that well should honestly be running a business, rather than trading equity.
4. Value investing has become much more difficult, as Buffett himself admits. Information is much more readily available. This has severely devalued non-ignorance.

While value investors benefit from extensive research and deep understanding of individual companies, options traders benefit from broad knowledge of market trends. Stock picking profits from private information and knowledge. Options trades profit from public fear and exuberance - apt for today's social media environment.
