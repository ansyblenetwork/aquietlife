title: "The case against options Greeks"
---

The Black-Scholes model for options pricing is a very nice piece of mathematics. 

However, I am unaware of any theoretical or notational significance for the associated options Greeks. To justify their existence, they need to be have empirical value. Unfortunately, I am not aware of any reason to think that they succeed in this. I am reminded of this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW6LYuli7VU) with Richard Feynman:

Here is a transcript of the relevant anecdote:

> My cousin at that time - who was three years older - was in high school and was having considerable difficulty with his algebra. I was allowed to sit in the corner while the tutor tried to teach my cousin algebra. I said to my cousin then, "What are you trying to do?" I hear him talking about x, you know.
> 
> "Well, you know, 2x + 7 is equal to 15," he said, "and I'm trying to figure out what x is," and I says, "You mean 4." He says, "Yeah, but you did it by arithmetic. You have to do it by algebra."
> 
> And that's why my cousin was never able to do algebra, because he didn't understand how he was supposed to do it. I learned algebra, fortunately, by—not going to school—by knowing the whole idea was to find out what x was and it didn't make any difference how you did it. There's no such a thing as, you know, do it by arithmetic, you do it by algebra. It was a false thing that they had invented in school, so that the children who have to study algebra can all pass it. They had invented a set of rules, which if you followed them without thinking, could produce the answer. Subtract 7 from both sides. If you have a multiplier, divide both sides by the multiplier. And so on. A series of steps by which you could get the answer if you didn't understand what you were trying to do.
