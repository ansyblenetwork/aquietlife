title: "Buy capital, never premium"
---

According to the principle of capital efficiency with respect to the [case for shorting options contracts]({% post_url 2021-06-28-case-for-trading %}), you should never buy extrinsic value, or premium.

This rule is absolute. Some contrarian implications include:

1. You should not spend more than the least possible amount on the defensive legs of spreads and other multi-leg strategies.
2. You should not "take profits at 50% or 21 DTE," a popular recommendation by Tasty Trade.



### Never buy extrinsic value

More generally, there is no reason to think that the case for shorting options can be ignored depending on your trading circumstance. In fact, adherence to the rule is the whole point of being an options seller. The skill of an option seller is to be willing to go through some inconvenience to develop risk management from scratch and for free, rather than paying someone else to offer a guarantee.

Another way to think about this is to ask when you would buy an options contract in isolation. For a true believer in the case for shorting options contracts, the answer should be: essentially never.


### Buy capital at a reasonable interest rate

The defensive leg of a spread offers two unrelated services: 

1. speculation, and
2. release of capital.

You should never sell a spread while expecting to take a total loss. Equivalently, you should fully expect to take a total loss on the defensive leg of every spread. This means you should value (1) at essentially zero. Accordingly, you should view the defensive leg of a spread as overpriced unless it is a good value for (2) alone. In other words, it should release capital to you at a reasonable interest rate. (Regardless of the price, you should only buy the defensive leg if you have an immediate need for capital.)

What is a reasonable interest rate? I personally indulge a bit. In principle, your broker's margin rate is the correct comparison, but I typically allow myself to pay up to a 10% annual rate. Some benchmarks:

1. A 7 DTE 10 dollar strike should cost at most 2 dollars.
2. A 7 DTE 25 dollar strike should cost at most 5 dollars.
3. A 7 DTE 50 dollar strike should cost at most 10 dollars

The same interest rate analysis answers the question of when to close a contract. (There are of course, exceptions. For instance, there are reasons to close a trade early if fundamental issues have arisen for the underlying stock.)


### An exception: Bear spreads

The one systematic exception I make to this rule occurs when building bear spreads. Precisely, the defensive leg of a bear spread seems to be a necessary evil. In the midst of exuberance, even the highest strike in an options chain is often not priced at a sane interest rate. (However, in such situations, the CBOE often decides to extend the chain, which typically corresponds to sloppy trading and some good opportunities.)
