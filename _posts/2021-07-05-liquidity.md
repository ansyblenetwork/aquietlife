title: "Tactics III: Favoring illiquid strikes"
---

Given the opportunity, you should trade options at strikes with low liquidity. This is fairly obvious to me, but I have never heard anyone recommend it.

The thesis is simple: You trade to find market inefficiencies, and illiquid securities are more likely to be inefficient.


### The case for seeking liquidity

There are only a couple of reasons I can think of to avoid illiquidity:

1. you want to drop a ton of capital and do not want to move the market, or 
2. you are afraid of being taken advantage of via insider information. 

However, (2) prevents itself with a catch-22: Someone with insider information would not be trading illiquid strikes, due to (1).

As for (1), someone with enough capital for this to be a burden should probably move on to trading something else.


### The case for seeking illiquidity

I think the thesis already stands without further justification, so I will just repeat it: Illiquid securities are likely inefficient, and inefficiency is a desirable resource for traders.

Another way to think about this is that you want to sell something at a price where almost no one is willing to buy it (or conversely, to buy something at a price where almost no one is willing to sell it). This is one of the primary reasons I like trading options. There is nothing else quite like it: You have free access to a snapshot of everyone in the country willing to buy or sell a product, with no low-liquidity visor.

For those who are new and/or skeptical about the data, you can quickly test this for yourself: When you place an order to sell at a price above the current ask, your order will appear in the bid-ask spread, assuming it is not immediately executed. (If you have suspicions, this visibility can be confirmed cross-broker; I checked.)


### Example: Trading at the ends of options chains

Some of my favorite trades recently have been on penny stocks, with 50 cent or 1 dollar strikes, and willing buyers. These are typically not easy to find, but they were reasonably common during the GME and AMC squeezes this year. Example tickers have included SNDL, SIEB, EXPR, and GNUS. When you do find such inefficiencies, you can be extremely confident in their disproportionate profitability relative to risk. (You needn't try these four tickers near the time of writing; no one is buying. People learn pretty quickly. Incidentally, another sign that your trades are good is if they are not repeatable.)

Another one of my favorite trades is to find options chains which have recently been extended. These are also rare, and indicate extreme exuberance and sloppy trading. Example tickers have included the meme stocks: AMC, TRCH, and WISH. The strategy here is typically to sell bearish call spreads. This is not for the faint of heart.
